# CLAUDE.md - Law Study Guide Project

## Project Overview

This is a **comprehensive law study guide** designed as a **mobile-first, scroll-optimized web application** providing 100% coverage of bar exam topics for Contracts, Criminal Law, and Torts. The core philosophy is **pure scrolling with zero navigation required**.

## Core Design Philosophy

### **Mobile-First Approach**
- **Primary target**: Mobile devices (phones, tablets)
- **Touch-optimized**: All spacing, typography, and interactions designed for touch
- **No taps required**: Everything visible and accessible through scrolling only
- **Full expansion**: No collapsible sections, no hidden content, no navigation menus
- **Responsive design**: Works perfectly from 320px phone screens to desktop

### **Pure Scroll Environment**
- **Zero navigation**: No menus, tabs, accordions, or collapsible sections
- **Linear content flow**: Topics progress logically from basic to advanced
- **Immediate access**: All content loads and displays instantly
- **No cognitive overhead**: Focus entirely on learning, not interface interaction
- **Continuous reading**: Designed for extended study sessions without interruption

### **Educational Content Strategy**
- **Easy definitions**: Complex legal concepts explained in plain English (ELI5 style)
- **Complete coverage**: Every topic and subtopic from standard law school outlines
- **Structured elements**: Legal elements clearly listed and visually distinguished
- **Proof elements**: What must be proven in court highlighted with `<span class="proof-element">`
- **Mnemonics included**: Memory aids for complex multi-part legal rules

## Visual Design System

### **Color Palette**
```css
/* Dark theme for reduced eye strain during long study sessions */
--background: #0f0f23      /* Deep navy background */
--text-primary: #e8e8f0    /* Light gray text for readability */
--gold: #ffd700           /* Headers and key concepts */
--coral: #ff6b6b          /* Section categories */
--cyan: #4ecdc4           /* Subsections and elements */
--dark-blue: #1a1a2e      /* Definition backgrounds */
--darker-blue: #16213e    /* Element list backgrounds */
```

### **Typography Hierarchy**
```css
/* Georgia serif font for optimal readability */
body: font-family: 'Georgia', 'Times New Roman', serif;
h1: 28px, gold (#ffd700) - Main title
h2: 24px, gold (#ffd700) - Subject headers (CONTRACTS, CRIMINAL, TORTS)
h3: 20px, coral (#ff6b6b) - Topic categories (Formation, Defenses, etc.)
h4: 18px, cyan (#4ecdc4) - Individual legal concepts
h5: 16px, cyan (#4ecdc4) - Sub-concepts when needed
```

### **Content Structure Components**
```html
<!-- Definition blocks: Plain English explanations -->
<div class="definition">
    Easy-to-understand explanation of the legal concept
</div>

<!-- Element lists: Structured legal requirements -->
<div class="elements">
    <strong>Elements that must be proven:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="proof-element">Specific legal requirement</span></li>
    </ul>
</div>
```

### **Visual Design Details**
- **Definition blocks**: Gold-bordered (`#ffd700`), dark navy background (`#1a1a2e`)
- **Element blocks**: Cyan-bordered (`#4ecdc4`), darker navy background (`#16213e`)
- **Proof elements**: Cyan-colored spans that highlight what must be proven in court
- **Generous spacing**: 20px padding, large margins for comfortable touch interaction
- **Rounded corners**: 8px border-radius for modern, friendly appearance
- **Subtle shadows**: Adds depth without overwhelming the content

## Content Architecture

### **Complete Coverage Verified**
- **Contracts Law**: 89 topics covering Formation → Third Party Rights → Conditions → Discharge → Remedies
- **Criminal Law**: Complete coverage from Formation → Inchoate → Homicide → Property → Defenses
- **Torts Law**: Full spectrum from Intentional → Negligence → Strict Liability → Vicarious → Products

### **Content Quality Standards**
- **Plain English definitions**: Complex legal concepts explained simply
- **Structured elements**: Every legal test broken down into provable elements  
- **Comprehensive subtopics**: No gaps - every outline item included
- **Professional mnemonics**: Memory aids for multi-part rules (e.g., "Does Public Intercourse Cause VD?" for Third Party Beneficiary)
- **IRAC methodology**: Content structured to support legal analysis framework

### **File Structure**

## User Experience Principles

### **Study Flow Optimization**
1. **Open and scroll**: No setup, no navigation, immediate access to content
2. **Visual hierarchy**: Color-coded sections guide natural eye movement
3. **Consistent structure**: Predictable patterns aid rapid comprehension
4. **No interruptions**: Pure content consumption without interface distractions
5. **Memory reinforcement**: Mnemonics and repetition aid long-term retention

### **Mobile Study Experience**
- **Thumb-friendly**: All content accessible via one-handed scrolling
- **No precision required**: No small buttons or links to tap accurately
- **Natural reading flow**: Content progresses logically through subjects
- **Comfortable spacing**: Prevents accidental taps and eye strain
- **High contrast**: Readable in various lighting conditions

## Development Guidelines

### **Content Addition Rules**
- **Always add definition blocks** for new concepts using `<div class="definition">`
- **Always include element lists** using `<div class="elements">` with proof-element spans
- **Maintain heading hierarchy**: h2 (subjects) → h3 (categories) → h4 (concepts) → h5 (sub-concepts)
- **Use plain English**: Explain complex legal concepts in simple terms
- **Include mnemonics**: Add memory aids for multi-part rules when helpful

### **Design Consistency Requirements**
- **Preserve color system**: Gold headers, coral categories, cyan concepts
- **Maintain spacing**: Consistent margins and padding throughout
- **Follow mobile-first**: Test on mobile devices, optimize for touch
- **No navigation elements**: Resist adding menus, tabs, or collapsible sections
- **Keep dark theme**: Maintain low eye strain color palette

### **Quality Assurance Standards**
- **Complete coverage**: Verify every outline item is included
- **Accurate content**: Legal information must be precise and current
- **Consistent formatting**: All topics follow the same structure pattern
- **Mobile testing**: Verify functionality on actual mobile devices
- **Content validation**: Cross-reference with authoritative legal sources
