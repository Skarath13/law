        <h2>CONTRACTS LAW</h2>
        
        <h3>Formation</h3>
        
        <h4>Governing Law</h4>
        <div class="definition">
            Whether common law or UCC applies - UCC covers sales of goods, common law covers everything else like services and real estate
        </div>
        <div class="elements">
            <strong>Key distinctions:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="proof-element">UCC Article 2</span> applies to sales of goods</li>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Common law</span> applies to services, real estate, employment</li>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Mixed contracts</span> use predominant purpose test</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>Valid Contract</h4>
        <div class="definition">
            A deal that courts will enforce - basically when two people agree to something and the law says "yep, you both have to do what you promised"
        </div>
        <div class="elements">
            <strong>Elements that must be proven:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Mutual Assent</span> (Offer and Acceptance)</li>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Consideration</span></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>Offer</h4>
        <div class="definition">
            When someone says "I'll do X if you do Y" with enough detail that the other person can say yes and make a binding deal
        </div>
        <div class="elements">
            <strong>Elements that must be proven:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Definite Terms</span> (Q-Tips: Quantity, Time, Identity of parties, Price, Subject matter)</li>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Communication to offeree</span></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>Termination of Offer</h4>
        <div class="definition">
            Ways an offer can die before anyone accepts it - like expiring, or the person who made it dies, or it becomes illegal
        </div>
        <div class="elements">
            <strong>Methods of termination:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Lapse of time</span></li>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Death or incapacity of offeror</span></li>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Destruction of subject matter</span></li>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Supervening illegality</span></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>Revocation</h4>
        <div class="definition">
            When the person who made an offer changes their mind and takes it back before the other person says yes
        </div>
        <div class="elements">
            <strong>Elements that must be proven:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Communication of revocation</span></li>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Before acceptance</span></li>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Effective when received</span></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>Rejection</h4>
        <div class="definition">
            When someone says "no thanks" to an offer - once you reject it, you can't change your mind and accept it later
        </div>
        <div class="elements">
            <strong>Elements that must be proven:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Clear refusal of offer</span></li>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Communication to offeror</span></li>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Counteroffer acts as rejection</span></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>Acceptance</h4>
        <div class="definition">
            Saying "yes, I agree" to someone's offer - but it has to match exactly what they offered (no changes allowed)
        </div>
        <div class="elements">
            <strong>Elements that must be proven:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Mirror image rule compliance</span></li>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Communication to offeror</span></li>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Timely acceptance</span></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>Consideration</h4>
        <div class="definition">
            Both sides have to give up something of value - you can't have a one-sided deal where only one person benefits
        </div>
        <div class="elements">
            <strong>Elements that must be proven:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Bargained-for exchange</span></li>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Legal detriment or benefit</span></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Defenses to Formation</h3>

        <h4>Parol Evidence Rule</h4>
        <div class="definition">
            If you put your agreement in writing, you generally can't bring up side conversations or promises that contradict what's written down
        </div>

        <h4>Statute of Frauds</h4>
        <div class="definition">
            Some important deals (like buying land or agreements taking over a year) must be written down or courts won't enforce them
        </div>
        <div class="elements">
            <strong>Elements that must be proven:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Contract falls within statute</span> (marriage, year, land, executor, goods over $500, surety)</li>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Writing signed by party to be charged</span></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>Duress</h4>
        <div class="definition">
            When someone forces you into a deal by threatening you - like "sign this or I'll hurt you"
        </div>
        <div class="elements">
            <strong>Elements that must be proven:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Improper threat</span></li>
                <li><span class="proof-element">No reasonable alternative</span></li>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Induced the contract</span></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>Fraud</h4>
        <div class="definition">
            When someone lies to you on purpose to get you to agree to a deal, and you believe the lie
        </div>
        <div class="elements">
            <strong>Elements that must be proven:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="proof-element">False representation of material fact</span></li>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard</span></li>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Intent to induce reliance</span></li>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Justifiable reliance</span></li>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Damages</span></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>Unconscionability</h4>
        <div class="definition">
            A deal so ridiculously unfair that it makes judges go "wait, what?" - like charging $10,000 for a candy bar
        </div>
        <div class="elements">
            <strong>Elements that must be proven:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Procedural unconscionability</span> (unfair bargaining process)</li>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Substantive unconscionability</span> (unfair terms)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>Mistake</h4>
        <div class="definition">
            When both people (or just one person that the other knew was confused) were wrong about important facts when making the deal
        </div>
        <div class="elements">
            <strong>Elements that must be proven:</strong>

                <li><span class="proof-element">Mistake existed at contract formation</span></li>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Mutual mistake OR unilateral mistake known to other party</span></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>Negligent Misrepresentation</h4>
        <div class="definition">
            When someone in business tells you something false because they were careless about checking their facts
        </div>
        <div class="elements">
            <strong>Elements that must be proven:</strong>

                <li><span class="proof-element">Justifiable reliance</span></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>Incapacity</h4>
        <div class="definition">
            When someone can't legally make contracts - like kids, mentally ill people, or extremely drunk people
        </div>
        <div class="elements">
            <strong>Elements that must be proven:</strong>
            <ul>

                <li><span class="proof-element">Lack of understanding of nature and consequences</span></li>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>Illegality</h4>
        <div class="definition">
            Deals to do illegal stuff - courts won't help you collect money for selling drugs or hiring a hitman
        </div>
        <div class="elements">
            <strong>Elements that must be proven:</strong>

        <h4>Adhesion Contract</h4>

        <div class="definition">
            Someone who gets benefits from a deal they weren't part of making - like when your parents hire someone to pay your college tuition
        </div>
        
        <h4>Define Third Party Beneficiary</h4>
        <div class="definition">
            A person who is not a party to the contract but who benefits from it and may have rights to enforce it
        </div>
        
        <h4>Privity</h4>
        <div class="definition">
            Third party beneficiaries can sue even without privity of contract - they get rights through the original parties' intent
        </div>

        <h4>Actual Causation</h4>
        <div class="definition">
            Proving that your carelessness actually caused the harm - "but for" your actions, would the person still be hurt?
        </div>
        <div class="elements">
            <strong>Elements that must be proven:</strong>

                <li><span class="proof-element">Substantial factor test</span></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>Proximate Causation</h4>
        <div class="definition">
            Even if you caused harm, you're only responsible if it was the kind of harm that was reasonably foreseeable
        </div>
        <div class="elements">
            <strong>Elements that must be proven:</strong>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>Watch the Time Line!</h4>
        <div class="definition">
            Important reminder: analyze the sequence of events carefully to determine if intervening causes break the chain of causation
        </div>

        <h4>Direct Causation</h4>
        <div class="definition">
            When defendant's negligent act directly causes plaintiff's harm without any intervening forces
        </div>
        <div class="elements">
            <strong>Elements that must be proven:</strong>

                <li><span class="proof-element">Foreseeable type of harm</span></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>Intervening Acts</h4>
        <div class="definition">
            Forces that come between defendant's negligent act and plaintiff's harm - may or may not break the chain of causation
        </div>

        <h4>Independent Intervening Acts</h4>
        <div class="definition">
            Intervening forces that operate independently of defendant's negligence - more likely to be superseding and cut off liability
        </div>
        <div class="elements">
            <strong>Examples:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Acts of God (earthquakes, lightning)</span></li>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Criminal acts by third parties</span></li>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>Dependent Intervening Acts</h4>
        <div class="definition">
            Intervening forces that are triggered or made more likely by defendant's negligence - less likely to be superseding
        </div>
        <div class="elements">
            <strong>Examples:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Negligent medical treatment</span></li>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Rescue attempts</span></li>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Foreseeable reactions by others</span></li>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Subsequent accidents caused by original negligence</span></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>Res Ipsa Loquitur</h4>
        <div class="definition">
            "The thing speaks for itself" - when something bad happens that usually only occurs due to negligence, like surgical tools left inside patients
        </div>
        <div class="elements">
            <strong>Elements that must be proven:</strong>
            <ul>

                <li><span class="proof-element">Instrumentality under defendant's exclusive control</span></li>
                <li><span class="proof-element">No contributory negligence by plaintiff</span></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>Damages</h4>
        <div class="definition">
            What kind of harm you can recover for in negligence - generally requires physical injury, not just emotional harm
        </div>

        <h4>Physical Harm Needed</h4>
        <div class="definition">
            Traditional rule that you must suffer physical injury or property damage to recover in negligence - pure economic loss usually not recoverable
        </div>
        <div class="elements">
            <strong>Elements that must be proven:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Physical injury to person OR</span></li>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Physical damage to property</span></li>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Economic loss tied to physical harm</span></li>
                <li><span class="proof-element">No pure economic loss recovery</span></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>NIED (Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress)</h4>
        <div class="definition">
            Recovery for emotional harm caused by negligence - very limited, usually requires physical symptoms or being in zone of danger
        </div>
        <div class="elements">
            <strong>Elements that must be proven:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Severe emotional distress</span></li>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Zone of danger OR bystander recovery</span></li>

        <h3>Negligence Defenses</h3>

        <h4>Contributory Negligence</h4>
        <div class="definition">
            When you were also being careless and that helped cause your own injury - in some states, you get nothing
        </div>
        <div class="elements">
            <strong>Elements that must be proven:</strong>
            <ul>

                <li><span class="proof-element">Failure to protect own safety</span></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>Comparative Negligence</h4>
        <div class="definition">
            Your damages get reduced based on how much the accident was your own fault - like 70% their fault, 30% yours
        </div>
        <div class="elements">
            <strong>Types:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Pure Comparative</span> (damages reduced by any % fault)</li>
                <li><span class="proof-element">Modified Comparative</span> (no recovery if plaintiff >50% at fault)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>Last Clear Chance</h4>
        <div class="definition">
            Even if you were being careless, if the other person could have easily avoided hurting you at the last second, they're still liable
        </div>
        <div class="elements">
            <strong>Elements that must be proven:</strong>
            <ul>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>Assumption of Risk</h4>
        <div class="definition">
            You can't sue for injuries from risks you knew about and voluntarily took - like getting hurt in a boxing match
        </div>
        <div class="elements">
            <strong>Elements that must be proven:</strong>
            <ul>

        <h4>Joint, Concurrent, and Successive Liability</h4>
        <div class="definition">
            Different ways multiple defendants can be liable - acting together, acting separately at same time, or one after another
        </div>
        <div class="elements">
            <strong>Types:</strong>
            <ul>

        <h4>Joint & Several Liability</h4>
